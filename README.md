# CircuitGraph
Scripts that take in verilog benchmark file for either synchronous or asynchronus circuits, and produces a json file represented the circuit graph for that circuit. 
Total shared takes in a circuit graph and creates a csv file with the gates that are shared with the locked key


Looks simple but written pre chat gpt
